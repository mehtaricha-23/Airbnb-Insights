# 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis

![Airbnb Analysis](https://your-image-link-here.com/image.jpg)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb data to uncover insights related to pricing, neighborhood trends, and host activity. We use **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn** for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier removal, and formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns in pricing, popular neighborhoods, and top-rated hosts.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, boxplots, bar charts, and time series analysis.
- **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)**: Predicting rental prices based on features like location, room type, and reviews.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-data-analysis.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd airbnb-data-analysis

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the analysis script:

```bash
python airbnb_analysis.py
```

## 📁 Dataset
This project uses Airbnb dataset from **Kaggle**. Ensure the data files are placed in the `data/` folder.

## 📈 Visualizations
We generate insightful charts such as:
- 🔹 Top 10 Expensive Neighbourhood
- ![Expensive Neighbourhood](Images/Expensive%20nighbourhood.png)

- 🔹 Top 10 Hosts with Highest Ratings
- ![🔹 Top 10 Hosts with Highest Ratings](Images/Hosts%20High%20Ratings.png)

- 🔹 Heatmaps for correlation analysis.

## 🤖 Machine Learning - Price Prediction
We apply **Linear Regression** to predict the price of an Airbnb listing based on:
- Number of Bedrooms
- Location
- Room Type
- Reviews

## 📝 Conclusion
- Identified **factors affecting Airbnb prices**.
- Developed a **predictive model** for rental prices.
- Gained insights into **top-performing hosts and areas**.
