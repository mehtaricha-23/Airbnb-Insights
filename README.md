![Airbnb Analysis](https://your-image-link-here.com/image.jpg)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb data to uncover insights related to pricing, neighborhood trends, and host activity. We use **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn** for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier removal, and formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns in pricing, popular neighborhoods, and top-rated hosts.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, boxplots, bar charts, and time series analysis.
- **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)**: Predicting rental prices based on features like location, room type, and reviews.

- Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
- Boxplots to identify outliers.
- Bar charts for popular neighborhoods.

## 🤖 Machine Learning - Price Prediction
We apply **Linear Regression** to predict the price of an Airbnb listing based on:
- Number of Bedrooms
- Location
- Room Type
- Reviews
